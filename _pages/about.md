About me
======
I am a recent graduate of Bachelor of Computer Science from Universiti Sains Malaysia and a student researcher for School on Internet Asia. I majored in Computing Infrastructure with specialization in Netcentric and Embedded Computing. Over the last few years, I have been an active member of School of Internet Asia community, working as student researcher, teaching assistant, and NOC engineer.

My interest span broadly in the area of network engineering and system administration.
